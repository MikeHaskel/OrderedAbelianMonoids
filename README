This program finds the ordered abelian unital monoids of a given size.
Note that the unit element is not considered to contribute to the
size.  When invoked with a size as a single argument, the program will
print the ordered abelian unital monoids of that size to the terminal
(standard output).


Output format:

Each monoid occupies one line of output.  As an example, consider the
following output line:

  [[2,1,1,0],[1,1,0],[1,0],[0],[]].

This line is to be read as the following upper triangular matrix:

  2 1 1 0
    1 1 0
      1 0
        0.

This matrix is, in turn, to be considered as the upper part of the
(symmetric) multiplication table for the non-unit elements of the
monoid.  The numbers themselves refer to these non-unit elements, in
reverse order.  That is, in this size four example, if our monoid
consists of elements

  0 < a < b < c < d,

then "a" corresponds to "3" in the printed output, "b" corresponds to
"2", "c" corresponds to "1", and "d" corresponds to "0".  Beware that
"0" in the printed output does not correspond to the unit of the
monoid.  Putting this all together, the example line corresponds to
the following multiplication table:

  __|_0_|_a_|_b_|_c_|_d_
  0 | 0   a   b   c   d
  a | a   b   c   c   d
  b | b   c   c   c   d
  c | c   c   c   c   d
  d | d   d   d   d   d
